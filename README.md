# Pixel Vac
## PHP Script that will convert images to CSS3 box shadows

----------------------


### Description
----------
This code came about after attempting to achieve an entirely different result. The 
aim was to recreate an image pixel by pixel so that I could individually manipulate
those pixels based on mouse movements and create 'melting', 'warping' and sandstorming 
wind blowing fantastical animations or transitions for sliders.

Turns out the approach has a serious appetite for resource memory. I ended up canning 
the idea until further notice - But the script itself did allow me to recreate an image 
purely out of CSS3 box shadows. That was kinda neat.

So here it is, in all it's experimental form. I'm releasing this to the public because 
I figured if anyone else was able to bring this to fruition or at least find some *other* 
use for it that would make me feel totally rad.

### Usage
----------

Just download this bad boy and point the script to an image. Play with it. Go crazy. 
I'd love to see what people can achieve with Pixel Vac or any derivative of it.
